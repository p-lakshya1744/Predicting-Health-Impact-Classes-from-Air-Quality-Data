# Air Quality Health Impact Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict health impact classes based on air quality data. The classes include Very High, High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low, representing the severity of health risks associated with air pollution.

## Aligned Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)

This project aligns with **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**, focusing on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all.

## Internship Acknowledgment

This project was completed under the **IBM SkillsBuild internship**, where I applied machine learning techniques to analyze air quality data and predict health impacts.
